Here’s an optimized and detailed version of your prompt with added context, clarity, and structure to ensure Replit AI fully understands your requirements:

Optimized AI Modeling & UI/UX Improvements
1. Modeling Optimization
Current State: The modeling looks great but has room for improvement.

Request: Optimize the design and functionality of the model as much as possible. Consider:

Performance improvements (e.g., faster calculations, reduced redundancy).

Enhanced visual clarity (e.g., better labeling, intuitive data representation).

Logical flow adjustments to improve usability.

2. UI/UX Adjustments for the AI Modeling Page
Issue: The page incorrectly shows the Dashboard view header and top bars, which should not be present.

Request:

Remove all Dashboard-related UI elements (header, top bars, etc.) from the AI Modeling page.

Ensure the page only displays relevant modeling controls and outputs.

3. Input Persistence & Layout Restructuring
Current Problem:

When a user inputs a value (e.g., Price of Offer: 14000 in Product Parameters) and switches to another section (e.g., Sales & Marketing), the previously entered value is lost/reset.

Requested Fix:

Implement state persistence so that input values are retained when switching between sections.

Store inputs in a temporary model or cache until final submission.

Layout Improvement:

Current: Inputs are split into separate sections (e.g., Product, Sales, Marketing) with a card-based navigation system.

Problem: This requires extra clicks and disrupts workflow.

Request:

Remove the multi-section card layout.

Display all input fields on a single page (with logical grouping if needed).

Use a scrollable or condensed form layout to avoid clutter.

Ensure all inputs are visible/modifiable without switching tabs.

4. Additional Suggestions (Optional Enhancements)
If possible:

Add input validation (e.g., numeric checks for price fields).

Include auto-save functionality to prevent accidental data loss.

Improve real-time feedback (e.g., live preview of model changes).

Why This Improves the Original Prompt:
Clearer Structure – Separates concerns (modeling, UI, inputs) for easier implementation.

More Detailed – Explains why changes are needed (e.g., input persistence improves UX).

Removes Ambiguity – Specifies exact UI elements to remove (Dashboard headers).

Future-Proofing – Optional enhancements give flexibility for further improvements.
